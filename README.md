# max1720xgetMinCurrent()` setCurrentAvgTime(int input_value)
Library for MAX17201 and 172015 i2c LI fuel gauges. Download ZIP and include with Arduino. Tested with ESP8266 Nodemcu.

### Modification Aug 2017
Cleaned up the code a bit, added more comments and some useful functions.

#### All functions:
```getVoltage()``` - gets the lowest cell voltage in mV

```getSOC()``` - LiIon Polymer battery as a percentage of the full capacity w/ resolution 1/256%

```getTemperature()``` - gets the getTemperature

```getCurrent()``` - gets the current in mA

```getAvgCurrent()``` - gets the average current consumption

```getMaxCurrent()``` - gets the max current since reset

```getMinCurrent()``` - gets the min current since reset

```getCapacity()``` - gets the current capacity of the batteries

```getTTE()``` - time left till empty

```getTTF()``` - time left till full

```reset()``` - resets the chip

```getBatteryStatus()``` - checks if the battery is present

```resetMaxMinAvgCurrent()``` - resets the maxmin avg current register

```setCurrentAvgTime(int input_value)``` - sets the current avg time based on input_value
